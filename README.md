# Tax Planning

> This web application displays different scenarios of a user's portfolio using a Monte-Carlo method to model the markets. The application could compare three different assets with different specifications and displays the projected gains using three different probability functions. It was built for the [PIEtech, Inc](https://www.moneyguidepro.com/ifa/). internship in summer 2018, as the third of three projects. It was built by a team of five interns: two business/technical analysts, two front-end developers, and a back-end developer. The time constraint for this project was three weeks.

---

#### Built with:

* [Aurelia](https://aurelia.io/)
* ASP.NET Core MVC Web API

---

#### My contributions:
* Worked together with another front end developer on the front end
* I did the results page which can be found in the results directory
* I did some work on the back-end which included handling the input model


#### Basic structure:

* Back-end code can be found in the `GuaranteedIncome` directory
* Front-end code can be found in the `web-app` directory

This code was never deployed; it was an intern project and the goal was to have a functional development build. The only way it has ever been run is a Webpack development server for the front-end and the Visual Studio built-in IIS Express server for the back-end. To run it on any other configuration, the fetch URL on the front-end will have to be changed, and, depending on the configuration, CORS may have to be reconfigured.
