# Tax Planning

> This web application compares annuity options and shows performance projections for various annuities with various riders based on market scenarios generated with a basic Monte Carlo method. It was built for the [PIEtech, Inc](https://www.moneyguidepro.com/ifa/). internship in summer 2018, as the second of three projects. It was built by a team of five interns: two business/technical analysts, two back-end developers, and a front-end developer.

---

#### Built with:

* [Aurelia](https://aurelia.io/)
* ASP.NET Core MVC Web API

---

#### My contributions:
* Built majority of the back-end using C# with .NET framework
* The contents of the Model and Controllers folder were primarily handled by me


#### Basic structure:

* Back-end code can be found in the `GuaranteedIncome` directory
* Front-end code can be found in the `web-app` directory

This code was never deployed; it was an intern project and the goal was to have a functional development build. The only way it has ever been run is a Webpack development server for the front-end and the Visual Studio built-in IIS Express server for the back-end. To run it on any other configuration, the fetch URL on the front-end will have to be changed, and, depending on the configuration, CORS may have to be reconfigured.
